# Blockchain Commons dCBOR Diagnostic Parser (TypeScript)

> Disclaimer: This package is under active development and APIs may change.

## Introduction

`@bcts/dcbor-parse` provides tools for parsing and composing the [CBOR diagnostic notation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949#name-diagnostic-notation) into [dCBOR](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/) (Deterministic CBOR) data items.

It is intended for use in testing, debugging, and other scenarios where a human-readable representation of dCBOR is useful.

## Rust Reference Implementation

This TypeScript implementation is based on [bc-dcbor-parse-rust](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-dcbor-parse-rust) **v0.10.0** ([commit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-dcbor-parse-rust/tree/df2c4279982a35e1c1ead8ecd9f8bb16c9bd6add)).
