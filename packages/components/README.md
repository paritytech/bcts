# Blockchain Commons Secure Components for TypeScript

> Disclaimer: This package is under active development and APIs may change.

## Introduction

A collection of useful primitives for cryptography, semantic graphs, and cryptocurrency, primarily for use in higher-level [Blockchain Commons](https://blockchaincommons.com) projects. All the types are [CBOR](https://cbor.io) serializable, and a number of them can also be serialized to and from [URs](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md).

Also includes a library of CBOR tags and UR types for use with these types.

## Rust Reference Implementation

This TypeScript implementation is based on [bc-components-rust](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-components-rust) **v0.30.0** ([commit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-components-rust/tree/f3d0081db048da942f316aa4cb5128af8921edd8)).
