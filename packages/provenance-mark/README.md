# Blockchain Commons Provenance Marks for TypeScript

> Disclaimer: This package is under active development and APIs may change.

## Introduction

[Provenance Marks](https://provemark.com) provide a cryptographically-secured system for establishing and verifying the authenticity of works in an age of rampant AI-powered manipulation and plagiarism. By combining cryptography, pseudorandom number generation, and linguistic representation, this system generates unique, sequential marks that commit to the content of preceding and subsequent works. These marks ensure public and easy verification of provenance, offering robust security and intuitive usability. Provenance Marks are particularly valuable for securing artistic, intellectual, and commercial works against fraud and deep fakes, protecting creators' reputations and the integrity of their creations.

## Specification

Provenance Marks are specified in [this white paper](https://provemark.com).

## Rust Reference Implementation

This TypeScript implementation is based on [provenance-mark-rust](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/provenance-mark-rust) **v0.22.0** ([commit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/provenance-mark-rust/tree/234f7fefe380b06f65e153d8f4faf664ab0ba2c4)).
