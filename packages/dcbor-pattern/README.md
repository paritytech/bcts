# Blockchain Commons Pattern Matcher for dCBOR (TypeScript)

> Disclaimer: This package is under active development and APIs may change.

## Introduction

`@bcts/dcbor-pattern` provides a powerful pattern matching language for querying and extracting data from [dCBOR](https://github.com/leonardocustodio/bcts/tree/main/packages/dcbor) (Deterministic CBOR) structures. It supports value matching, structural patterns, and meta-patterns with named captures.

The pattern language is designed to be expressive yet concise, allowing you to match complex nested structures with simple pattern expressions.

## Rust Reference Implementation

This TypeScript implementation is based on [bc-dcbor-pattern-rust](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-dcbor-pattern-rust) **v0.11.1** ([commit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-dcbor-pattern-rust/tree/f796d7560f8d39b57b9c1e925cb932ee70860804)).
