# Blockchain Commons Random Number Utilities for TypeScript

> Disclaimer: This package is under active development and APIs may change.

## Introduction

`rand` exposes a uniform API for the random number primitives used in higher-level [Blockchain Commons](https://blockchaincommons.com) projects, including a cryptographically strong random number generator and a deterministic random number generator.

The crate also includes several convenience functions for generating secure and deterministic random numbers.

## Rust Reference Implementation

This TypeScript implementation is based on [bc-rand-rust](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-rand-rust) **v0.5.0** ([commit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-rand-rust/tree/8f53717e35300933e9ca1bc6c51bddc0854cfb9e)).
